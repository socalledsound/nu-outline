### week 2 : Hooks, State, Router

## let's flip the old order and start with Router??

#### v1 what is a SPA ( 3-5 mins)

#### v2 react-router (7.5 mins)

    -- Router in index
    -- Switch, Route, Redirect in App

#### v3 Header (10 mins?)

    -- link vs Link

#### v4 Footer (5 mins)

#### v5 Subheader (Breadcrumbs) (5 mins)

#### v6 make our homempage

    -- HomePage with Menu component and MenuCard

#### v7 moar pages

    -- download AboutPage, ContactPage
    -- CampsiteDirectory Page
    -- NOW what we need is a way to select a campsite

#### v1 10 mins HOOKS overview + comparison to class-based components

    -- What is a 'hook'?
    -- what are the main hooks?
    -- why were they introduced?
    -- are there alternatives?  not really but in some old code you will see class based components like this example here
    -- generally hooks replace the most important elements of class based components
    -- one reason they're better is, they are specific to a certain task
    -- this is good functional programming!!!

#### v2 useState

    --useState()
    -- (array destructuring aleady covered but remind them)
    --clickable heart with FA
        -- ternary operator

#### v3 useState on CampsiteDirectoryPage

    -- Selected Campsite
    -- useState on Campsite Directory Page for selectedCampsite -- >
    -- campsiteDetail component

### and finally : params

--CampsiteDetailPage
-- move campsite detail to a new page and use the cool hook
