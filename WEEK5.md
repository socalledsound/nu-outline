## React Course Outline week 5

# ASYNC REDUX ++ ASYNC JAVASCRIPT

## old stuff to keep:

    client server communication
    fetch but I'd like to redo and expand on promises
    thunk, but needs to be updated
    we already did animation but will need to revisit it for the loading state
    building and deployment
        -- those three sections are pretty good?
        -- but I think we should lean on the CI approach harder because it's so much better

#### v1 callback functions

    -- set timeout x 2
    -- how do we wait until the first one has finished?

#### v2 PROMISES

#### v3 basic API call with useEffect()

    -- (RESEARCH SOME COOLER APIS?)

#### v4 Async Redux 1: thunks pt 1

#### v5 Async Redux 2: thunks pt 2

#### v6 Async Redux 3: createAsyncThunk

#### v7 campsitesSlice Async stuff

# ((( will have to also refactor the animations )))
