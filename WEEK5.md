## React Course Outline week 5

# ASYNC REDUX ++ ASYNC JAVASCRIPT ++ let's make that carousel

## old stuff to keep:

    client server communication
    fetch but I'd like to redo and expand on promises
    thunk, but needs to be updated
    we already did animation but will need to revisit it for the loading state
    building and deployment
        -- those three sections are pretty good?
        -- but I think we should lean on the CI approach harder because it's so much better

#### v1 callback functions

    -- set timeout x 2
    -- how do we wait until the first one has finished?

#### v2 PROMISES

#### v3 basic API call with useEffect()

    -- (RESEARCH SOME COOLER APIS?)

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API

#### v4 Async Redux 1: thunks pt 1

#### v5 Async Redux 2: thunks pt 2

#### v6 Async Redux 3: createAsyncThunk

#### v7 campsitesSlice Async stuff

# ASYNC animations



# CAROUSEL ALT

    -- ok, now that you've learned React and Redux, I've got an assignment for you.
    -- I'm kind of a tough client. you built one version of the home page, but I want a
    different one.  Everybody's talking about these Carousel things and I want one.
    -- here's what I want: (show it.)
    -- Can you do it?
    -- Start by adding some buttons to the home page, so we can toggle back and forth between
    styles.
    -- then write a Carousel component page, that we go to when button 2 is clicked.
    -- Once you've got that out of the way, take a stab at implementing a carousel!
    -- here's a hint: you can use React spring.
  
    
    -- now go see if you can build out the buttons and the toggle, using what you know 
#### v8

    -- CHALLENGE -- make the buttons and a toggle using useState
    -- challenge answer
    -- two options, for now one just says carousel
    -- the other one, we build:
        -- introducing react spring

comment form, post feedback
